# Maritime Inspection Platform - Enterprise Architecture Blueprint

This document translates the current monolithic FastAPI + MongoDB implementation into a production-grade, service-oriented platform while preserving the existing React frontend and the maritime inspection workflow already present in `backend_v2/`.

## 1. Current State

Current shape:

`React Frontend -> FastAPI API -> Routers -> MongoDB`

Observed characteristics from the existing codebase:

- FastAPI app bootstraps routers directly in `backend_v2/main.py`
- MongoDB is accessed from application code without a strict repository boundary
- AI processing is currently co-located with the main backend and writes artifacts locally
- Uploaded files, outputs, and generated reports are stored on local disk
- Auth and session logic exists, but not as a hardened enterprise security layer

## 2. Target State

Target shape:

`React Frontend -> Nginx/API Gateway -> FastAPI Core API -> Services -> Repositories -> MongoDB`

Side services:

- Redis for cache, sessions, queues, rate limiting, and websocket state
- Celery workers for background jobs
- Dedicated AI microservices for inference
- MinIO or S3 for binary storage
- RabbitMQ or Redis queue for async messaging
- Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry for observability

## 2.1 Workflow-Aligned Microservice Shape

For the workflow shown in your diagram, the backend should behave like an AI pipeline orchestrated by microservices rather than one large pipeline runner.

Recommended request flow:

`Frontend -> API Gateway -> Workflow Orchestrator -> Event Bus -> AI/Review/Reporting Services -> Storage + Databases`

Service map for the workflow:

- `api-gateway-service`  
  Handles auth, routing, request limits, and correlation IDs.
- `upload-ingestion-service`  
  Accepts vessel metadata, videos, and images; stores raw media in object storage.
- `workflow-orchestrator-service`  
  Owns pipeline state, checkpoints, retries, and resume logic.
- `frame-extraction-service`  
  Extracts frames from uploaded videos and publishes frame batches.
- `ai-classification-service`  
  Runs ship area classification and part recognition.
- `ai-defect-detection-service`  
  Runs defect segmentation/detection on frames.
- `temporal-consistency-service`  
  Deduplicates, tracks, and validates defects across frames.
- `defect-quantification-service`  
  Calculates area, severity, and confidence scores.
- `cost-estimation-service`  
  Estimates repair cost from defect type, area, and severity.
- `human-review-service`  
  Routes low-confidence items to ship repair engineers or dockyard inspectors.
- `explainability-service`  
  Produces evidence frames, traceable reasoning, and model explanations.
- `report-generation-service`  
  Builds generated documents and repair summaries.
- `analytics-service`  
  Feeds dashboard metrics, defect trends, and fleet-wide reporting.

Suggested communication pattern:

- synchronous REST only for lightweight lookups and approvals
- async events for AI inference, document generation, and long-running jobs
- durable workflow checkpoints in MongoDB
- media and generated artifacts in MinIO or S3
- Redis for cache, locks, and short-lived progress state
- RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis Streams as the event bus

## 4. Service Boundaries

### Core API

Owns:

- request validation
- authN/authZ
- orchestration of use cases
- audit logging
- websocket fan-out
- workflow state transitions

Should not own:

- direct MongoDB queries
- model loading
- long-running inference
- PDF generation

### Services

Business logic layer:

- `InspectionService`
- `DefectService`
- `WorkflowService`
- `ReportService`
- `NotificationService`
- `AuthService`
- `SessionService`
- `AuditService`

### Repositories

Data access layer:

- `UserRepository`
- `SessionRepository`
- `InspectionRepository`
- `DefectRepository`
- `ReportRepository`
- `AuditRepository`
- `NotificationRepository`

## 5. Authentication And Authorization

Use:

- short-lived JWT access tokens
- rotating refresh tokens
- token family revocation
- server-side session registry in Redis
- role-based and permission-based access control

Roles:

- Super Admin
- Admin
- Manager
- Inspector
- Surveyor
- Client

Reusable guards:

```python
@require_role("Admin", "Super Admin")
@require_permission("inspection:approve")
```

Security rules:

- store refresh token identifiers, not raw secrets
- rotate refresh tokens on every refresh
- revoke the entire token family on suspicious reuse
- bind sessions to device metadata and IP heuristics
- require CSRF protection for cookie-based refresh flows

## 6. Security Controls

Implement at gateway and API layers:

- rate limiting with Redis-backed counters
- brute-force and credential-stuffing throttles
- IP allow/deny lists
- request size limits
- strict CORS allowlists
- security headers
- input sanitization for user-controlled fields
- NoSQL injection-safe query builders
- structured audit logging
- password policy enforcement
- replay protection for sensitive actions

Recommended headers:

- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `Referrer-Policy`
- `Permissions-Policy`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`

## 7. Redis Usage

Redis should be used for:

- cache-aside reads
- session registry
- refresh token rotation lookup
- rate limiting counters
- OTP storage
- websocket presence and room state
- Celery broker or result backend if RabbitMQ is not used

## 8. Async Processing

Use Celery workers for:

- AI inference jobs
- PDF/report generation
- notification fan-out
- email sending
- image processing
- thumbnail generation

Job lifecycle:

`API request -> enqueue job -> worker executes -> store result -> notify client`

Add:

- retries with exponential backoff
- idempotency keys
- dead-letter handling
- job status persistence

## 9. AI Microservices

Separate services:

- damage detection service
- severity prediction service
- repair recommendation service
- cost estimation service

Main API rule:

- the FastAPI core must never load AI models directly

Communication:

- REST for synchronous requests
- queue/event-based messages for long jobs

Suggested AI service contract:

```text
POST /infer/damage-detection
POST /infer/severity
POST /infer/repair-recommendation
POST /infer/cost-estimation
GET  /health
GET  /metrics
```

## 10. Storage Architecture

Use MinIO or S3 for:

- image uploads
- video uploads
- generated PDFs
- attachment archives

MongoDB should store:

- object key
- bucket
- media type
- file size
- checksum
- inspection association
- upload metadata

## 11. WebSocket Architecture

WebSocket responsibilities:

- connection manager
- heartbeat/ping tracking
- reconnect-safe session identity
- presence tracking
- notification broadcast
- progress streaming for jobs

Channels:

- inspection status updates
- AI progress updates
- report generation progress
- approvals and workflow notifications

## 12. Observability

Metrics:

- request latency
- error rate
- queue depth
- worker throughput
- MongoDB latency
- Redis latency
- websocket connections
- AI inference duration

Logging:

- request ID
- correlation ID
- user ID
- tenant or org ID if added later
- audit events
- security events

Tracing:

- instrument gateway, API, worker, and AI service boundaries with OpenTelemetry

## 13. MongoDB Design

Recommended collections:

- `users`
- `roles`
- `permissions`
- `sessions`
- `refresh_tokens`
- `inspections`
- `defects`
- `media_assets`
- `workflow_events`
- `approvals`
- `reports`
- `notifications`
- `audit_logs`
- `jobs`

Index strategy:

- compound indexes for common lookups
- TTL indexes for sessions, OTPs, and ephemeral jobs
- soft-delete fields for audit-safe retention
- pagination with stable sort keys

## 14. API Versioning

Expose:

- `/api/v1`
- `/api/v2`

Gateway responsibilities:

- request tracing
- compression
- central exception mapping
- OpenAPI publishing
- auth propagation

## 15. Deployment Topology

Containers:

- React frontend
- FastAPI core API
- Redis
- MongoDB
- MinIO
- Celery worker
- Celery beat
- RabbitMQ if selected
- AI microservices
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Loki
- Nginx reverse proxy

Recommended runtime:

- one API container per pod
- horizontal worker scaling
- separate autoscaling for AI services
- stateless API nodes
